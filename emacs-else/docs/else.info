Introduction
************

   These days a number of packages exist for Emacs that provide what
users think of as "templates" or "skeletons" or code "abbreviations".
When they first go in search of something to help generate code they
are thinking of something that will allow the generation of common code
constructs (usually control structures or file/function headers) with a
small number of keystrokes (similar to the Emacs abbreviation
facility). For instance, a user might be interested in a package that
generates an "if" statement, they envisage such as package generally
working like an abbreviation i.e. "if<some Emacs command/key sequence>"
which then leaves a tailored "if" construct in their buffer, where they
can then "fill in the blank" or missing portions of the code.

   ELSE (Emacs Language Sensitive Editor) provides this functionality
via what is called "tokens" (*note Expanding Tokens::) plus much more.
The following example shows the use of a token definition taken from
the C language templates, this definition generates an "if" construct.
The key-stroke sequence to generate this command (assumes installation
of ELSE has been achieved) is `ifC-c / e' with the following result in
the buffer:

       if ({expression}) {
         {statement}...
       }
       [elsif_part]...
       [else_part]

After the expansion, the cursor is automatically positioned within the
first placeholder (`{expression}' and the user can just start typing the
condition expression, ELSE will automatically delete the placeholder
text and replace it with the typed information.

   ELSE takes what I will term a "whole language" approach to helping
generate code. Not only does it provide code "abbreviations" but it
also provides facilities that allow generation of a code file from
initial empty buffer to completed file - all without having to leave
the template system. Indeed, it is possible to code a typical language
file without having to manually type a single language keyword or
construct. This "whole language" approach utilises what is termed
"placeholders" (*note Expanding Placeholders::). Given a sufficiently
detailed language template file (one that closely mirrors the EBNF (1)
for the language, for instance), then it is possible to achieve this
goal.

   A brief tutorial is offered (*note Tutorial::) showing the use of
both placeholders and tokens.

   Most people, when they start to explore language sensitive editing,
start out by looking for a system that allows them to specify language
"templates" -- a facility that will allow them to type in an
abbreviation which is then somehow expanded to the full language
construct i.e. `if' is expanded to the full syntax of the particular
language if statement. This is as far as they typically envisage a
templating package to work. ELSE provides this basic functionality via
what is termed "tokens". But ELSE goes much further than this, it
provides a system that allows the mimicking of the entire language
syntax i.e. it offers not only expansion of abbreviations but also
allows menu choices and the provision of information messages to the
user -- all within the syntax of an ASCII readable language definition
file. The structure of the language definition file is described fully
in the reference portions of this manual (*Note Creating and Modifying
Templates::).

   You might be asking the question - how is ELSE different from any of
the other template packages available for Emacs? ELSE differs from
other packages that aim to achieve the same goals in several ways:
  1. ELSE language template definitions are specified using a purely
     ASCII, textural syntax with no attempt at making them look
     ELisp-like. At least one user has seen this as a disadvantage
     though :-). To be fair, his argument was that why should he have
     to learn yet another "language" when if the template definitions
     could be defined using Elisp style syntax? There is no easy answer
     for this. As the author, I (obviously) thought that staying away
     from Elisp like syntax would be a benefit to a user i.e. they
     don't have to learn Elisp to use ELSE! At first glance, ELisp is
     not an easy language to pick up with its nested brackets etc -
     miss one and you are history! :-).

  2. ELSE language definition syntax conforms with a commercially
     available Editor(2).

  3. The user interface for using ELSE is completely visual i.e. other
     template/skeleton packages use an interface of questions/answers
     and have invisible "markers" to points of interest in the syntax
     generated. Thus their interface is not easy to use (once you
     embark into a Q&A session you are stuck with completing it - many
     such sessions require you to know the full extent of your code
     before you embark on it! e.g. how many case statements will be
     used in a switch statement and exactly what are the cases in which
     the program should take action? If you need further information to
     answer any of the questions then there is no way to just
     "interrupt" the season, switch to another buffer and look up the
     required information -- so you are either forced to continue on as
     best you can or abandon the Q&A session entirely). ELSE's
     placeholders or "markers" persist across edit sessions because
     they are actual text in the buffer, other template/skeleton
     packages use Emacs markers which are lost when the edit session
     for that file is ended.

  4. ELSE offers features that are missing in other packages e.g. the
     ability to have text automatically repeated as you type at a
     single place in multiple places within the language syntax i.e.
     function names can be repeated at the end of the function body as
     the name is typed by the user at the start of the body(3). It is
     possible to create flexible templates for commonly used language
     constructs using this feature i.e. coding for loops in C often
     have a similar, repetitive "pattern", using this feature of ELSE,
     typing can be kept to a minimum as the variable name is repeated
     in multiple places e.g.

          for (no_items = 0; no_items < 100; no_items++)

     is a very common construct - the auto-substitute feature of ELSE
     could allow the user to create the above code pattern such that
     the variable "no_items" was automatically repeated in two places
     as the first instance was typed by the user.

  5. ELSE language definitions can model the original language syntax
     either as loosely or closely as the template definition maintainer
     desires using a menu system that provides choices that follow
     language syntax branching. Thus a user can see what code syntax is
     possible at different points in the file without necessarily
     having to be an expert in the language in which the code is being
     generated. This means that ELSE can be a aid to beginning
     programmers as they learn the language in which they are
     generating code.

  6. ELSE offers a more "dynamic" interface than other similar
     packages. The user can "extract" and modify language template
     definitions "on the fly" whilst in an Emacs edit session. These
     changes can be either temporary i.e. last for the current edit
     session only or can be saved for future use in later sessions. In
     fact, ELSE is so dynamic that you can actually extract the contents
     of the entire language template set for the current edit session
     and save that for later (re)use.

  7. And lastly (but not least :-)), ELSE is extensively documented.
     Documentation for competitive packages are only just starting to
     emerge, use of those packages have thus been limited to those few
     who were prepared to invest the time to read Elisp and a few
     scattered examples to learn how to use the packages. ELSE template
     definition syntax and documentation hopefully allows even users
     who are not interested in programming in Elisp to enjoy the fruits
     of language sensitive editing quickly and (relatively) easily.

Overview of ELSE
****************

   ELSE is an implementation of a minor mode for Emacs that provides
language sensitive editing capability to the currently enabled major
mode (for the current buffer) of Emacs. It is aimed fairly and squarely
at providing support to programmers for input of program text but as
you will see it can be easily customised for any task that involves
repetitious input of common textual sequences.

   Use of ELSE will improve programmer productivity by reducing the
amount of time to enter the program/text in the first instance and in
the second instance, it will cut-down on time consuming errors due to
typing mistakes i.e. syntax errors that are usually found by the
compiler during the compile - edit cycle e.g. missing ;'s become a
thing of the past.

   The aim of ELSE is to reduce programming to an exercise of "filling
in the blanks", hence the use of the term "template" language. Language
constructs are the templates and the variable, procedure and function
names are the "blanks".

   There are a number of ways of implementing so called "language
sensitive editing" (lse) in an editor. The most common approaches seen
in many editors that offer this feature take a very "primitive" form
where the programmer is left feeling that he/she could just as easily
do without e.g., many implementations offer the following behaviour:

  1. offer macros that would fill in some of the language syntax by
     straight generation of a portion of the chosen language statement
     leaving the user to position the cursor manually to where variable
     entry is required and manual deletion of (optional) portions of
     the syntax that are not required; or

  2. through a series of question/answer sessions, where at the end of
     the sequence, the language statement is deemed "complete" and is
     entered into the text buffer.

   These approaches tend to feel fairly "intrusive" to the programmer
and are generally awkward to use. In addition, they offer little or no
help to the novice in possible selections of syntax.

   The approach to Language Sensitive Editing offered here for Emacs is
modelled after a feature found in a editor offered by Digital Equipment
Corporation(1) called LSE. This approach to the problem does not suffer
from any of the usual awkwardness associated with typical lse
implementations. It provides a natural framework for the programmer
where the work is limited to menu selections and "filling in the
blanks" e.g., a typical "template" (*note Definitions::) in ELSE looks
like:

     [context_clause]...
     package {program_unit_name} is
       {basic_declarative_item}...
     [private_part]
     end [program_unit_name];

This is the template for a `package' specification in Ada. Each of the
textual strings inclosed by `{}''s or `[]''s are language
"placeholders" (*note Definitions::) that offer further expansion
possibilities through either menu selection, text substitution or
language prompts e.g., if the placeholder `[context_clause]' is
"expanded" then the contents of the buffer will become:

     with {library_unit_name}...; [use_clause]
     [context_clause]...
     package {program_unit_name} is
       {basic_declarative_item}...
     [private_part]
     end [program_unit_name];

Observe that the placeholder `[context_clause]...' has been expanded
and replaced with the two lines:


     with {library_unit_name}...; [use_clause]
     [context_clause]...

Upon expansion, ELSE replaced the placeholder `context_clause' with its
definition, namely the text `with {library_unit_name}...;
[use_clause]'. It detected that the placeholder was to be repeated (the
trailing ...) and thus duplicated the placeholder being expanded onto
the next line.

   After the expansion, the cursor will be automatically re-positioned
between the first set of `{}''s. The user then has options of further
expansion or performing straight text entry, if the text entry option
is exercised then the text within and including the `{}''s is
automatically deleted by the minor mode and replaced by the entered
text i.e. no awkward "killing" or "deleting" of text is required, the
minor mode recognises a valid(2) placeholder and responds appropriately
e.g.,


     with TEXT_IO, [library_unit_name]...; [use_clause]...

Note that the user has only typed the text `TEXT_IO', the `,' and the
repetition of the (optional) syntax/placeholder
`[library_unit_name]...' was automatically supplied by the minor mode
functionality. Just as `conveniently', if the programmer decides that a
second `library_unit_name' is not required then the placeholder can be
deleted (`else-expand-placeholder' (`C-c / e')) using a single command
with the following to result:


     with TEXT_IO; [use_clause]...

Note that ELSE has performed appropriate "housekeeping" and that the
`,' has been automatically deleted as nolonger required and the `;'
character is flush against the package name (TEXT_IO). Similarly, the
`[use_clause]' placeholder can be expanded upon or deleted.

   The preceeding examples have shown how ELSE offers language sensitive
editing via the "placeholder" mechanism. Another mechanism offered by
ELSE for quick generation of language syntax is via the expansion of
"token's". A token is usually used where no placeholders are available
i.e.  the programmer has deleted all placeholders but wants to add
further code to a particular section. He/She has the option of either
typing in a placeholder, such as, `{statement}'... or if a simple
construct is all that is needed, then he/she can type in a token and
perform expansion upon it. A "token" is an abbreviated string that has
been defined in the language templates to be expanded to a full
construct e.g.

     Code before entry with the ``token'' inserted at the desired point:
     
         Value1 := 10;
         Value2 := 20;
     
         if                        <---- require an ``if'' statement here
     
         Value3 := Value1 * Value2;

     Code after token is expanded:
     
         Value1 := 10;
         Value2 := 20;
     
         if {condition} then
           {statement}...
         [elsif_part]
         [else_part]
         end if;
     
         Value3 := Value1 * Value2;

   In the previous example, the abbreviation "if" is a token defined in
the Ada language templates which is defined to expand to an "if
statement" template.

Typographical Conventions
=========================

   ELSE uses the following typographical conventions:

  1. Curly braces `{}''s -- denote a mandatory entry e.g. `with
     {library_unit_name}', the language requires that a package name be
     supplied. Mandatory entries cannot be deleted (using the
     `else-kill-placeholder' (`C-c / k') command, that is), the user is
     warned by a error message in the command line of the editor.

  2. Square braces `[]''s -- denote an optional entry e.g.
     `[context_clause]' can be either deleted or `expanded'.

  3. 3 Dots ... -- denote the fact that the preceeding (or `attached')
     placeholder will be `automatically' repeated by the minor mode
     functionality when the user performs any actions other than the
     `else-kill-placeholder' (`C-c / k') command.

  4. ==> -- denotes the results of an "expansion" of either a
     placeholder or token e.g.
          [context_clause]... ==> with {library_unit_name}...; [use_clause]


File: else,  Node: Definitions,  Prev: Typographical Conventions,  Up: Overview

Definitions
===========

   The following terminology is used in this manual:

  1. `placeholder' -- Term used to denote a textual string that is
     recognisable or "defined" in the currently selected `language'
     mode. The string is enclosed by either `[]''s or `{}''s (*note
     Typographical Conventions::).

  2. `token' -- A (usually short) textual string that has been
     "defined" in the currently active language template. It can be
     expanded to provide a language template. This is (usually) used as
     a shorthand way of inserting a particular language construct.
     Tokens are textual strings which are not enclosed by `[]''s or
     `{}''s.

  3. `expand' or `expansion' -- Denotes the execution of the command
     `else-expand-placeholder'.

Installation Instructions
*************************

   To install ELSE, copy the Emacs Lisp file `else-mode.el' anywhere
into the load path of your installation of Emacs (I use the `site-lisp'
directory). Place the following command into your .emacs file:
     (require 'else-mode)

   ELSE also optionally supports the use of a support package called
setnu.el (mirrored/available from the same place that you copied
else-mode.el). This package is written by Kyle E. Jones and provides
line numbering support (if enabled - *Note Custom Variables::.) to the
display of menu choices. This feature is available so that individuals
using voice coding systems can easily pick the desired menu choice. The
setnu.el package should be copied to the same spot as else-mode.el.

   It is recommended, but not necessary, that you install the ELSE info
documentation. ELSE documentation consists of a TexInfo file
(else.texi), an info file (else.info) and a PDF file (else.pdf). Copy
the info file (else.info) into the Emacs Info directory and add the
following line to the `dir' file that can be found in the Emacs info
directory:

     * ELSE: (else.info).    Emacs Language Sensitive Editor.

   ELSE comes with a number of template definition files (*note
Template Availability::). Place the desired template definition files
anywhere in the Emacs `load-path' (the site-lisp directory is fine).


File: else,  Node: Default Keybindings,  Next: Command Summary,  Prev: Installation Instructions,  Up: Top

Default Keybindings
*******************

   Following the recommendations of the Elisp manual regarding minor
modes, ELSE provides a minor-mode map i.e. a map that is active only
when the minor mode is active, that binds the four main commands of
ELSE as follows:
  1. else-expand-placeholder - `C-c / e'

  2. else-next-placeholder - `C-c / n'

  3. else-previous-placeholder - `C-c / p'

  4. else-kill-placeholder - `C-c / k'

   Some lessor used commands and their bindings are:
  1. else-comment-placeholders - `C-c / c'

  2. else-uncomment-placeholders - `C-c / u'

  3. else-insert-placeholder - `C-c / i'

   Note that these bindings are purely provided to conform with the
conventions for such things as specified in the Emacs Lisp manual. My
personal preference is to bind the main four commands to `F3 - F6'. A
'quirk' of the operation of ELSE that is worth mentioning is that when
selecting items from the menu display, the command
`else-expand-placeholder' can also be used to select an item i.e. first
instance of the command over a placeholder will bring up a menu of
choices and then a second press of the keybinding will provide a
selection request - this provides faster and convenient selection for
the user at times e.g. a commonly selected menu option can be a quick as
`F3'/`F3' (assuming the desired option is the first entry in the menu
-- if it isn't then "customise" that placeholder definition and swap the
order of menu item!).

   For the convenience of novice/beginning Emacs programmers, here are
the key definitions that I use (place them in your .emacs or emacs.el
file -- whichever one you use):

     (global-set-key [f3] 'else-expand-placeholder)
     (global-set-key [f4] 'else-next-placeholder)
     (global-set-key [f5] 'else-previous-placeholder)
     (global-set-key [f6] 'else-kill-placeholder)

   A further "nice to have" in your .emacs file is to have else-mode
turned on automatically for each file that you edit. An example of how
to turn on ELSE for c-mode (C source files) is:

     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 ;; this is shown as a lambda so you can add further interesting
                 ;; minor mode definitions here.
                 (else-mode)))

   Refer to the Emacs manual for further information on major mode
hooks, when and how they are run to achieve customisation of an edit
environment.

Command Summary
***************

   The following user commands are provided by ELSE.

 - Command: else-mode
     Toggles the minor mode for the current buffer. If the buffer is
     empty then it inserts the "initial_string".

 - Command: else-expand-placeholder
     If the cursor is positioned within a "placeholder" (*note
     Definitions::) then the placeholder is expanded (1) according to
     the rules for the definition of that placeholder name. If the
     command is executed with the cursor immediately positioned after a
     valid token then the rules defined for that token are used in the
     expansion.

 - Command: else-next-placeholder
     Moves the cursor to the next valid placeholder in the current
     buffer.

 - Command: else-previous-placeholder
     Moves the cursor to the previous valid placeholder in the current
     buffer.

 - Command: else-kill-placeholder
     Kills or deletes the placeholder in which the cursor is currently
     positioned. Note that a numeric argument `C-u' will force a kill
     even when the placeholder is mandatory.

 - Interactive Command: else-cleanup-placeholders
     Command to delete every placeholder remaining in the current
     buffer. Mandatory and optional placeholders are all deleted using
     the else-kill-placeholder command.

 - Command: else-comment-placeholders
     Uses the comment syntax for the currently defined major mode to
     "comment out" any placeholders in the source file that have not
     been expanded or deleted. This command is useful for when a
     compilation is desired but coding is not yet deemed complete ie
     there are still placeholders in the buffer.

 - Command: else-compile-buffer
     Command to "compile" the language definitions found at `point' to
     the end of the buffer. When supplied with a numeric argument
     (`C-u') will compile definitions from the beginning of the current
     buffer.

 - Command: else-compile-fast-load
     Command to generate a "fast" load version of a language template
     file. A version of the language template file is created using the
     Emacs Lisp"read" syntax. When ELSE attempts to load a new language
     definition file it will first look for a "fast load" version of
     the file. Please note that this command is a "hold-over" from the
     days when PC's were very slow, this command probably should not be
     used as it will be removed from future versions of ELSE.

 - Interactive command: else-extract-all
     Extract all of the placeholders, tokens and the language
     definition for the current language into the current buffer at
     `point'.

 - Interactive command: else-extract-placeholder placeholder
     Prompts the user for a valid placeholder name and then extracts
     the placeholder definition into the current buffer (*note
     Customising An Existing Template Language::).

 - Interactive command: else-extract-token token
     Prompts the user for a valid token name and then extracts the
     token definition into the current buffer (*note Customising An
     Existing Template Language::).

 - Interactive Command: else-insert-placeholder
     Command to insert a placeholder string at point into the current
     buffer. It expects some leading characters of the placeholder
     prior to point at the time the command is invoked (these character
     must be preceeded by a "{" or "[" character). It will use this
     abbreviation to perform auto-completion on the placeholders loaded
     for the current language template file. If there are more than one
     possibilities, then the command will provide auto-completion of the
     unique portion of the placeholder and then stop, a second
     invocation will split the window and display a list of possible
     completions. This second window must be deleted manually (in the
     current version - a future release will probably fix this problem).

 - Interactive Command: else-move-n-placeholders
     Command to move to the "next" placeholder where "next" is
     controlled by the `else-direction' custom variable i.e. if
     `else-direction' is on then this command will invoked the
     `else-next-placeholder' (`C-c / n') command, if the
     `else-direction' flag is off then it will invoke the
     `else-previous-placeholder' (`C-c / p'). This command was added
     for "usability" for VR Programming, it helps reduce the number of
     voice commands required to use ELSE.

 - Interactive Command: else-show-token-names
     Display names of all of the Tokens in the current language
     template set, sort them alphabetically and display them in a
     temporary buffer.

 - Interactive Command: else-show-placeholder-names Display names of
          all of
     the Placeholders in the current language template set, sort them
     alphabetically and display them in a temporary buffer.

 - Interactive Command: else-toggle-direction
     Command to toggle the custom variable `else-direction'.

 - Command: else-uncomment-placeholders
     This command will go through the current buffer looking for
     placeholders that have been "commented out" using the comment
     syntax of the current major mode. The language comment syntax will
     be removed.

 - Interactive Command: else-wrap-region
     "Wrap" a template around a region of code. Mark the region to be
     enclosed by the template and then run this command, it will prompt
     for the placeholder name.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Note that if the placeholder text within the `{}''s or `[]''s is
not defined then the command will not recognise the placeholder string,
this is a common error when the user has manually (mis-)typed a
placeholder and can't work out why ELSE won't expand it.

Using ELSE
**********

   ELSE has been implemented as a minor mode of Emacs. This means that
each buffer within Emacs may have it own set of language templates
enabled, the only limit is the system resources that is running the
editor. So, Emacs may have multiple language definitions loaded at any
one time i.e. the user may be interfacing an Ada program to a C program
and so editing an Ada module in one buffer and a C file in another
buffer, ELSE could be enabled for both buffers and they will each have
the appropriate set of language templates enabled. The following
sections detail how to start up ELSE and use it in the course of normal
code entry.

Invoking ELSE
=============

   ELSE has been implemented as a minor mode of Emacs, it determines
which language specification to load either from the buffer's major
mode or, if it can't locate an appropriate template file name (*note
Building the Language Template File Name::), then it will prompt the
user to enter the template name. For example, if the major mode for the
current buffer is "C", then the major mode name will be "C" and ELSE
will attempt to load the "C" template file using the name "C.lse"
(*note Building the Language Template File Name::). Note that ELSE will
first check if the template file for the major mode is already loaded,
if not then it will search (*note Building the Language Template File
Name::) for the file, if it can't find the file then it will prompt the
user to enter a file name.

   After loading the language template file, ELSE will then search for a
"customisation" file for that particular language. The name of this
file is of the form <language_name>-cust.lse i.e. in the case of
loading a template file for the C language it would look for a
customisation file called C-cust.lse located anywhere in the load path.
Refer to *note Customising An Existing Template Language:: for more
information on this feature.

   To invoke ELSE use the command `else-mode'. If the current buffer is
empty then ELSE will insert the "initial_string" for the language
(*note Creating and Modifying Templates::) and position the cursor
within the placeholder(1).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) The four primary else commands (else-expand-placeholder,
else-next/previous-placeholder and else-kill-placeholder) each check
whether else-mode is enabled and will invoke it automatically if not set


File: else,  Node: Navigating,  Next: Expanding Placeholders,  Prev: Invoking ELSE,  Up: Using ELSE

Navigating Using ELSE
=====================

   Use the `else-next-placeholder' (`C-c / n') and
`else-previous-placeholder' (`C-c / p') commands to navigate forwards
and backwards through the buffer being edited. These commands will
locate the next/previous valid placeholder and move point into the
middle of the placeholder text. Each command can take a numeric
argument, if the desired number of placeholders are not available, then
point will be positioned to the last/first placeholder in the buffer.


File: else,  Node: Expanding Placeholders,  Next: Expanding Tokens,  Prev: Navigating,  Up: Using ELSE

Expanding Placeholders
======================

   Placeholders are expanded by positioning the cursor between the
`{}''s or `[]''s and executing the `else-expand-placeholder' (`C-c /
e') command. If the placeholder string is a valid placeholder then ELSE
will provide one of the following responses:

  1. Replace the placeholder with a lower level language construct e.g.
          [context_clause] ==> with {library_unit_name}...; [use_clause]

  2. Provide a choice of possible lower level language constructs via a
     menu selection scheme e.g.
          [type_declaration] ==> full_type_declaration
                                incomplete_type_declaration
                                private_type_declaration
                                private_extension_declaration

  3. Provide a prompt to the user that this is the lowest possible
     expansion and that the user must type in a replacement string i.e.
     expansion of the Ada placeholder `{expression}' will display the
     prompt:
          Enter an Ada expression as defined in section 4.4 of the LRM,
          for example:
          4.0, Pi, (1 .. 10 => 0), Integer'Last, Sine(X), not Destroyed
          Color'(Blue), 2*Line_count, -4.0 + A, B**2 - 4.0*A*C

   If a placeholder is followed by ellipses (...) then ELSE will
reproduce the placeholder automatically as the user either expands or
types into a placeholder. The placeholder may be replicated in either
the horizontal (same line) or vertical direction. The direction of
replication (*note Duplication Specifier::) is determined in the
definition of the placeholder.


File: else,  Node: Expanding Tokens,  Next: Deleting Placeholders,  Prev: Expanding Placeholders,  Up: Using ELSE

Expanding Tokens
================

   Tokens can best be thought of as a handy abbreviation for a
placeholder that can be expanded e.g. the token "if", when expanded,
gives the language construct for the if statement (example taken from
the C language templates but this is a very common token definition)
i.e.

     if ==> if ({expression})
           {
              {statement}...
           }
           [else statement]

   Tokens are most commonly used when the main portion of the code has
been entered and the programmer/user is in the compile/fix-up cycle
i.e. the placeholders have been removed from the source file to make it
compilable but the programmer needs to add further statements. The
options available at this point depends on the scope of the change
required, if a major piece of code needs to be added then it is usually
best to manually type in a placeholder that can be used as a good
starting point e.g. [statement]... is a pretty common definition in
almost any language definition template.


File: else,  Node: Deleting Placeholders,  Next: Preparing for Compilation,  Prev: Expanding Tokens,  Up: Using ELSE

Deleting Placeholders
=====================

   Use the command `else-kill-placeholder' (`C-c / k') to delete a
placeholder located under point. Note that if the placeholder is a
mandatory entry (enclosed by `{}''s rather than `[]''s) then ELSE will
issue an error message and ring the bell.

   To delete all placeholders in a buffer, use the command
`else-cleanup-placeholders'. This command will start at the beginning of
the buffer and delete every placeholder (mandatory or optional)
contained in the buffer. This is a convenient method of performing a
"final" clean-up after completing the coding of an program file.


File: else,  Node: Preparing for Compilation,  Next: Disabling ELSE,  Prev: Deleting Placeholders,  Up: Using ELSE

Preparing for Compilation
=========================

   Often a user will wish to compile the current buffer even though
code entry has not been completed. Two commands are provided for
convenience during this phase of coding:

  1. `else-comment-placeholders' -- Comment all lines that contain
     placeholders, this uses the comment syntax defined by the current
     major mode. It uses the Emacs `comment-region' command to
     accomplish this process (1)

  2. `else-uncomment-placeholders' -- Uncomment all placeholders in the
     current buffer. This command is provided to reverse the effects of
     the `else-comment-placeholders' command and return the buffer to a
     state ready for more code entry by the user.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) you definitely want to do this because the typical compiler won't
compile ELSE placeholder templates! But it is a "nice to have" because
you might not have finished writing code and thus don't want to lose
all of your placeholders. By using `else-uncomment-placeholders' you
can quickly reverse the effect and start coding again.


File: else,  Node: Disabling ELSE,  Prev: Preparing for Compilation,  Up: Using ELSE

Disabling ELSE
==============

   To disable ELSE just type the command `else-mode' to toggle ELSE
off. Note that any template language definitions that have been loaded
will remain loaded into Emacs memory. To explicitly delete a set of
language definitions the user must either stop and re-start the Emacs
session or use a DELETE LANGUAGE specifier (*note Language
Identification::) which must be "compiled" by ELSE using the command
`else-compile-buffer' (*note Command Summary::).

Creating and Modifying Templates
********************************

   This section covers the details of how to create and modify language
template definitions. The aim is to give the user a basic
understanding, which when coupled with looking at real template
definitions, will allow the creation of new language templates and the
customisation of existing template definitions.

   Commands that are used in this activity are:

  1. `else-compile-buffer' -- "compiles" ELSE template definitions from
     point until the end of the current buffer. When supplied with a
     numeric argument (`C-u'), will compile from the beginning of the
     current buffer.

  2. `else-extract-all' -- will "extract" the definition of the entire
     enabled language definition file into the current buffer at point.

  3. `else-extract-placeholder'(1) -- extract the template definition
     of a placeholder into the current buffer at point. The command will
     prompt the user for the name of the placeholder to extract.

  4. `else-extract-token' -- extract the template definition of a token
     into the current buffer at point. The command will prompt the user
     for the name of the token to extract.

File: else,  Node: Syntactic Conventions,  Next: Customising An Existing Template Language,  Prev: Creating and Modifying Templates,  Up: Creating and Modifying Templates

Syntactic Conventions for Template Definitions
==============================================

   General syntactic conventions used in a language template file:

  1. Template definitions are not case sensitive i.e. a placeholder
     definition for If_Statement is the same as a definition for
     IF_STATEMENT. Also the current version of ELSE expects all
     "standard" template definition strings (such as DEFINE, LANGUAGE
     etc) to be upper case. I don't really see any reason to fix this
     up, it would just slow down the regular expression searching when
     the template file is loaded. The only exception to the case
     sensitivity rule is that the language name is case sensitive i.e.
     if you are defining a new definition for Emacs-Lisp and call it
     EMACS-LISP then you will get an error message to the effect that
     language Emacs-Lisp doesn't exist!

  2. Enclose text strings that contain embedded spaces with quotes.

  3. Enclose _text strings_ to the right of an equal (=) sign in
     quotes, this rule does not apply to "standard" values such as
     `NONTERMINAL, TERMINAL, MENU' etc.

Customising An Existing Template Language
=========================================

   Probably the first thing you will want to do after the initial
exploration of using ELSE is to start to customise the templates for
your own environment and use. Experience will show that only a small
number of templates require customisation and then it will largely
depend upon the "phase" in your code entry i.e. you might find yourself
coding a section that has a large number of `case' constructs and not
so many `if' constructs, so rather than have to pass over the `if'
construct in a menu to get to the `case' construct continually, just
customise the "statement" placeholder so that the `case' construct
occurs before the `if' construct i.e.

   Before:
     DELETE PLACEHOLDER STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
         /DESCRIPTION=""
         /DUPLICATION=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT -
         /SEPARATOR="" -
         /TYPE=MENU -
     
         "null_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "if_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "case_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "loop_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "block_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "accept_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
          .
          .
          .
     
     END DEFINE

   After:
     DELETE PLACEHOLDER STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
         /DESCRIPTION=""
         /DUPLICATION=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT -
         /SEPARATOR="" -
         /TYPE=MENU -
     
         "case_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "if_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "null_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "loop_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "block_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "accept_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
          .
          .
          .
     
     END DEFINE

   To achieve the above change you would perform the following sequence:

  1. Extract the definition for STATEMENT using the command
     `else-extract-placeholder' and supplying STATEMENT as the argument;

  2. Edit the definition by swapping the "if_statement" and
     "case_statement" lines and moving the "null_statement" below the
     "if_statement" line;

  3. "compile" the new definition by positioning point at the beginning
     of the `DELETE PLACEHOLDER' line and running the command
     `else-compile-buffer'.

   Note that you can accomplish the above in any buffer in your Emacs
session. The change will only exist for that edit session unless you
either save the changed template definition (either into the main
language template file or the language custom file).

   Note also that the language templates are held as a `global'
variable within the Emacs session, so any changes you make to the
template definitions in one buffer will be in effect for every other
buffer that has ELSE mode enabled and that particular set of language
templates selected.

   Other reasons for the desire to perform customisation of a set of
language templates also exist. One such is the establishment of a
"global" set of common templates across a number of users (usually to
help enforce project coding standards). In this case, each user may
want to provide their own customisations but make sure that they don't
impinge on other users. For this reason, ELSE searches and loads a
"customisation" language file immediately after loading the primary
language file i.e. loading a language file comprises two steps, the
loading of the <language>.lse file and then the searching and loading
of a customisation file <language>-cust.lse. The customisation file may
be located anywhere in the Emacs load path i.e. it doesn't have to be
in the same directory as the primary template file and can be used to
not only provide new template definitions but also provide "overrides"
for definitions in the "global" language template file. In this manner,
we can achieve several goals:

  1. distribution of a standard language template file which remains
     constant; and

  2. allow projects and groups to use the same template file.

   and yet still provide the facility to have individual template
characteristics. An example of this is the first release of ELSE
contained language template files that contained file and function
headers that had been customised for previous projects and coding
standards that I had worked on. These definitions went out in the
original distribution as an example of how people could produce such
things but neglected the very real problem of providing a central
repository for a standard set of templates for a particular language.
The current language template file distribution have these definitions
extracted from the main template file and <language>-cust.lse files are
provided with these definitions in them. These definitions can then be
readily edited for the particular project the user is working on
without incurring incompatibilities with the central distribution.

   The main feature of the ELSE definition language that allows these
customisations to work is the sequence of a template definition where
the placeholder/token is first DELETE'd and then DEFINE'd (*note Delete
Placeholder Statement:: and *Note Define Placeholder Statement::). This
means that any existing template definition is wiped and then
completely redefined for the current edit session.

File: else,  Node: Extracting Placeholders or Tokens,  Next: Create a New Language,  Prev: Customising An Existing Template Language,  Up: Creating and Modifying Templates

Extracting Placeholders or Tokens
=================================

   To customise a set of language template definitions you can either
edit the original definition file to make the change permanently or, if
you are after just a temporary change to a definition, you can
`extract' the definition into the current buffer, make your change and
then recompile the definition into the current editing session.

   The commands to access the currently loaded language definitions are
`else-extract-all', `else-extract-placeholder' or `else-extract-token'.
The latter two commands will extract an individual definition of the
type indicated whereas the first command will extract the entire
definition. The process of "extraction" will leave the desired
definition in the current buffer at `point'. Note that definition name
completion is available when typing in the name of the definition to
extract. Once the modifications have been made then the definition can
be re-compiled into ELSE using the command `else-compile-buffer' (*Note
Command Summary::.

   These changes go into effect at a global level i.e. if there are
multiple buffers loaded with the same language template then they all
see the same change.


File: else,  Node: Create a New Language,  Next: Definition of the Template Structure,  Prev: Extracting Placeholders or Tokens,  Up: Creating and Modifying Templates

Creating a New Language
=======================

   A language template file is best started from a set of EBNF for the
target language. The structure of the language definitions take the
form of the classical inverted tree structure commonly found in
computer science literature i.e. portion of the Ada language template
structure looks like:

                                  initial string
                                        |
                ---------------------------------------------------------------
                |                        |                        |           |
         library_unit_declaration   library_unit_body       separate_body   ...
                .                        |                        .
                .              ---------------------              .
                .              |                   |              .
                        subprogram_body       package_body

   Here the placeholder definitions of `subprogram_body' and
`package_body' expand directly to the language constructs and the user
is then taken to the top of the tree again for the "lower level"
definitions.

   Each template file starts out with a "language definition" template
(*note Language Definition Template::) (the root of the tree) and then
proceeds into the individual branches using placeholder and token
definitions.  Each element of the template syntax is defined and
explained in the following sections.

Language Identification
.......................

   `Lineno 1 - 2' -- Any given Emacs session can have multiple source
files loaded, each with their own set of language templates i.e. the
user could be editing a C source file, a C++ source file and an Ada
source, ELSE could be turned on for each buffer. So, language
definition files need a mechanism to uniquely identify the language to
which the definition will be applied. A language definition file always
starts out with the same two lines, the `DELETE LANGUAGE {language
name}'(1) and `DEFINE LANGUAGE {language name}'. Because each ELSE
session is customisable, each template definition construct (`LANGUAGE',
`PLACEHOLDER' and `TOKEN') includes a `DELETE' and `DEFINE' command
pair. By using a convention of `DELETE' and then `DEFINE' we ensure
that the definition being "replaced" or changed will be deleted and
then defined anew. Thus to define a new language the following two
lines are:

     DELETE LANGUAGE "XXX" -
     DEFINE LANGUAGE "XXX" -

   This deletes a complete language definition called "XXX" (and all of
its associated placeholder and token definitions) and then commences
defining a new language called "XXX".

being turned on is empty. When ELSE mode is enabled for a buffer it
will make sure the appropriate set of language definitions are loaded
and then check if the buffer is empty, if the buffer is empty then the
text string defined by this specifier will be inserted into the buffer.
This text string is usually the template that appears at the top of the
language definition tree i.e. `{compilation_unit}'.

Punctuation characters
......................

   `Lineno 4' -- The specifier `/PUNCTUATION_CHARACTERS' defines the
punctuation characters for the language being defined. This affects how
the "housekeeping" efforts of ELSE work. It helps the code determine
where whitespace should or should not occur. e.g. when deleting the
optional placeholder for the parameters of the following procedure
specification:

       procedure TEST [formal_part];

   then we want the following:
       procedure TEST;
   rather than:
       procedure TEST ;
   In this example, the function `else-kill-placeholder' (`C-c / k')
command noticed that the `;' character is defined as a punctuation
character by the Ada Language Definition and thus it should ensure that
no whitespace exists between the punctuation character and the
preceeding function name.

(`C-c / e') ELSE "compiles" the string specified by the
/VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS attribute into the following Elisp regular
expression:

     [^%s+]

   where the "%s" is replaced by the text string
/VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS. This regular expression means "search for
any character which is not in the range of characters". The entire
string between "point" (current cursor location) and the character
found by this search is taken to be the text of the token the user is
requesting an expansion for.

   Since this search uses Emacs regular expression syntax, care needs
to be exercised in the text actually placed in the
/VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS attribute. If the user wishes to alter
this attribute, they are advised to become familiar with Emacs regular
expression syntax prior to attempting any changes.

   As an example, the following situation is put -- the user wants to
modify a set of language templates so that they can use a token
consisting of the character sequence "?:" (the "C" ternary operator
could be generated this way). Just creating a token with a name of "?:"
will not work as the two characters will not be part of the
/VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS set and therefore attempting to "expand"
the string "?:" would fail to find a valid string to search the token
database with.

   So the logical first cut by the unwary would be to add these
characters at the end of the existing string attribute for
/VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS thusly:

           /VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEF \
                                         GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_0123456789-?:"

   However, since this string is used as a regular expression, the
character sequence "9-?" will be interpreted as "all characters in the
range from 9 to ?" rather than as the user intended i.e. the individual
characters "9", "-", "?" and ":". The "correct" place to add the
sequence "?:" would be anywhere in the string _other than_ at the end
of the /VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS string i.e. this would be the
correct method of implementing this change:

           /VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS="abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEF \
                                         GHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_0123456789?:-"

   In fact, it might be better for template maintainers to make the
treatment of /VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS more "obvious" by using
something like this:

           /VALID_IDENTIFIER_CHARACTERS="a-zA-Z_0-9-"

   If a "user" was faced with modifying this, they might be tempted to
read further?

Indentation Size
................

   `Lineno 7' -- The line
       /INDENT_SIZE=2 -

   allows customisation of the identation of the code generated using
ELSE. This attribute allows the user to specify the indentation of each
line of the template. It provides a single point for the user to change
the indentation of the code generated by ELSE (previous versions of
ELSE did not contain this feature and thus, if your coding standard
required indention differently to that specified by the standard base
template, then you would have to edit the entire template file and
change all indented lines to the level required by your coding
standard).

   As ELSE loads and scans the template definition file it determines a
"normalised" value for the indentation of each line within each
definition by making the first line that shows an indentation (leading
space(s)) from the first line of the definition. If subsequent lines
show indentation which is greater that the "normalised" value then it
is assigned a further multiple of the INDENT_SIZE. This continues for
the scanning of the definition and the indentation of each line is
stored by ELSE. When ELSE is asked to insert the text lines for a
definition then it multiples each indentation value by the value
specified by INDENT_SIZE i.e. as an example, the text definition of a
switch statement might be:

         "switch ({expression}) {"
         "   [case_part]..."
         "      [default_part]"
         "}"

   Here we see at line 2 that we have an indentation of 3 spaces --
this value is calculated as a value of indentation of 1 times the value
contained in INDENT_SIZE. When line 3 is scanned, ELSE notes that it is
further indented and assigns a value of 2 to that line. When line 4 is
scanned ELSE notes that it has no indentation compared with line 1 and
is assigned an indentation level of 0 to that line.

   When ELSE inserts this definition, it will take the indentation
value of each line (0 for lines 1 and 4, 1 for line 2, 2 for line 3)
and insert the number of spaces determined by the indentation level
multipled by the value of INDENT_SIZE. Thus line 0 would be inserted
with no extra spaces, line 1 would have 2 spaces inserted, line 3 would
have 4 spaces inserted and line 4 would have 0 spaces inserted e.g.

     switch ({expression}) {
       [case_part]...
         [default_part]
     }

   To change the indentation of lines in ELSE, all the user has to do
is change the value of /INDENT_SIZE and "recompile" the language
template definition file.

   Note that if there is no indentation size specified then a default
value of 4 will be assumed. ELSE will produce a message when compiling
a language that contains no indentation size attribute specifier.

   Where the user might want to override the spacing of templates as
they are scanned by ELSE i.e. textual headers for functions/files might
be an example. ELSE has the facility of allowing "hard" spaces to be
inserted at the beginning of each line of a definition. These hard
spaces are indicated by a '@' character i.e.

This is a better solution to placing version labels in the comments
portion of language template files as if a user decides to "extract"
the entire language set then any comment headers are lost -- this
attribute allows people to see what version of the template file was
used as the base when the language template set was compiled.


File: else,  Node: Overriding Language Attributes,  Prev: Language Definition Template,  Up: Create a New Language

Overriding Language Attributes
------------------------------

   You can "override" any of the attributes of a language (attributes
have been described above) by providing a single `DEFINE LANGUAGE'
statement without the (normally) preceding `DELETE LANGUAGE' statement.
Just include the attribute that you wish to "override" and the new
value will take effect when you "compile" the new language definition.
Currently this feature of ELSE is only really useful for the
`/INDENT_SIZE' attribute i.e. the baseline language file may define a
value that is not appropriate for your project so you can redefine it
to some other value by placing a `DEFINE LANGUAGE' statement in the
<lang>-cust.lse file. For example, the following will re-define the
indentation size of C Language template definitions to be 4 spaces:


     DEFINE LANGUAGE C -
         /INDENT_SIZE=4 -
     
     END DEFINE

   When ELSE meets such a situation it will issue a "warning" message
i.e. "Language XXX exists, assuming attribute modification".

File: else,  Node: Auto Text Substitute,  Next: Description Specifier,  Prev: Define Placeholder Statement,  Up: Placeholders

Auto Text Substitute
....................

   `Lineno 5 --- Lineno 6' -- The attribute on Lineno 5 has two possible
values: `/AUTO_SUBSTITUTE' or `/NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE'. It works in
conjunction with count specified by the attribute on Lineno 6. This
attribute exists because it is quite common in many languages (or
coding styles) to repeat a text string multiple times within a language
construct e.g. in Ada the package name (`designator') is an optional
entry at the end of the package body:

     1 package body {designator} is
     2    {declarative_item}...
     3 [begin_package_body]
     4 end [designator];

   In the above example, it would be desirable if the second occurrence
of the "designator" string, shown at lineno 4, could be replaced with
the text of the first "designator" string (lineno 1) as the user types
it into the buffer. To achieve this behaviour in ELSE, the definition
of the "designator" placeholder would have the auto-substitute
attribute set and the substitution count attribute set as follows:

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER DESIGNATOR -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER DESIGNATOR -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /AUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
         /SUBSTITUTE_COUNT=2 -
         .
         .
         .
     
     END DEFINE

   The general behaviour of ELSE is that whenever the user starts to
enter text whilst positioned within a placeholder, ELSE will examine
the auto-substitute attribute for that placeholder and if it is set to
`AUTO_SUBSTITUTE' it will then search forward in the buffer looking for
`SUBSTITUTE_COUNT' matches of the placeholder string. Each matching
portion of the buffer is tagged using Emacs markers, then as the user
types in the text string at the first placeholder, the same text
(including backspaces etc) is repeated at each of the subsequent
matching sites. The duplication of changes to the subsequent textual
areas continues until the user makes a change to the buffer that is
outside the area of the original placeholder. Once such a change occurs
then all auto-substitution makers are erased.

   The default value for the `/SUBSTITUTE_COUNT' attribute is 1 i.e.
there will be one other place to perform a substitution.

   The following example shows an interesting example of the use of the
auto-substitute feature in the C language to create a "custom"
placeholder definition for the for loop i.e. it is quite common to have
a for loop where the count variable is repeated at three different
points in the same line. By defining a special placeholder name with an
auto-substitute count set appropriately then we can save some typing
i.e.

     DELETE TOKEN FOR -
         /LANGUAGE="C" -
     DEFINE TOKEN FOR -
         /LANGUAGE="C" -
         /DESCRIPTION="conditional, repeated statement execution"
     
         "for ({loop_var} = [0]; {loop_var} [<] {value}; {loop_var}[++])"
         "{"
         "   {statement}..."
         "}"
     
     END DEFINE
     
     DELETE PLACEHOLDER LOOP_VAR -
         /LANGUAGE="C" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER LOOP_VAR -
         /LANGUAGE="C" -
         /AUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
         /SUBSTITUTE_COUNT=2 -
         /DESCRIPTION="" -
         /DUPLICATION=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT -
         /SEPARATOR="" -
         /TYPE=TERMINAL
     
         "Enter a variable name."
     
     END DEFINE

   Here, the "loop_var" placeholder is defined to auto-substitute with
2 further occurrences. As the user types into the first occurrence of
the placeholder then that text will be repeated twice more.

   Note that if the placeholder definition specifies a repeat count but
that number of matches cannot be found at run-time then only the
placeholders that were matched will have the substitution performed.

   Another thing to note about this example, is that it shows a for
loop definition with some "common" options i.e. the initial value is
defined as a placeholder with a value of `0' when expanded, the loop
test is defined with a default of '<' and the loop counter is defined
with a default value of increment i.e. `++'. Since all three of these
items are defined as placeholders, the user has the option of
navigating between them and either selecting the default value or
typing in a new value.

The possible values are:

  1. VERTICAL -- the placeholder is duplicated vertically onto the next
     line.

  2. HORIZONTAL -- the placeholder is duplicated on the same line to
     the right of the placeholder being expanded.

  3. CONTEXT_DEPENDENT -- means the placeholder will be duplicated in
     either the vertical or horizontal direction. Some simple rules are
     applied in this case, if the placeholder is alone on the line then
     it is duplicated vertically, if there is text on the same line
     before the placeholder then it will be duplicated in the
     horizontal e.g.

          [statement]... ==> if {condition} then

Separator Specification
.......................

   `Lineno 9' -- The specifier `/SEPARATOR' is used to indicate the
characters that should be inserted automatically when the placeholder is
duplicated e.g. Ada uses the `|' character as a logical `or' symbol when
multiple conditions are applicable in a case statement, so when each
occurrence of the placeholder is expanded then ELSE automatically
inserts the character(s) defined by this specifier as part of the
placeholder duplication e.g. the placeholder definition for
"discrete_choice" is:

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER DISCRETE_CHOICE -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER DISCRETE_CHOICE -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -

         "others"

   and the expansion would be:

     when {discrete_choice}... => ==> when RED | [discrete_choice]... =>

   Note that the separator characters, `" | "' were automatically
inserted before the placeholder was repeated. ELSE also uses the
character(s) defined by the `/SEPARATOR' specifier when killing an
unwanted placeholder e.g.

     when RED | [discrete_choice]... => ==> when RED =>

Type Specifier

   `Lineno 10' -- The specifier `/TYPE' informs ELSE how to treat the
expansion of the placeholder. This specifier can have three possible
values:

  1. TERMINAL -- This is the "end of the line", no further expansions
     are defined and the text string(s) held in the body of the
     definition are to be used as a prompter to the user e.g. with the
     following definition for "identifier" placeholder

          DELETE PLACEHOLDER IDENTIFIER -
              /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
          DEFINE PLACEHOLDER IDENTIFIER -

              "Any Ada identifier will do"
          
          END DEFINE

     An expansion of this placeholder will provide the prompt of `Any
     Ada identifier will do' to the user. The prompt is displayed for a
     customisable period (*note Custom Variables::) in seconds and then
     erased from the screen. Note that is the user performs any entry
     during the display of the prompt string then the prompt buffer
     will be terminated immediately and the user input actioned.

  2. NONTERMINAL -- informs ELSE that the body of the placeholder
     definition contains one or more text strings which should be used
     to replace the placeholder ie. the following definition will
     provide this expansion
          [context_clause] ==> with {library_unit_name}...; [use_clause]

          END DEFINE

  3. MENU -- informs ELSE that the body of the placeholder definition
     contains a menu selection that must be presented to the user for
     resolution i.e. the following definition will present a menu of
     choices for the `statement' placeholder:

   `Lineno 12 - 16' -- The "body" of the template definition may
contain one or more text strings. These text strings will be used by
ELSE according to the setting of the `/TYPE' specifier (*note Type
Specifier:: for examples).

   When the placeholder body is a menu then each text line may contain
optional keywords. These keywords are:

  1. `/PLACEHOLDER' -- informs ELSE that the preceding text is the name
     of a placeholder.

  2. `/TOKEN' -- informs ELSE that the preceding text is the name of a
     token.

  3. `/FOLLOW' -- informs ELSE that if the line item is a placeholder,
     that is itself a menu, then incorporate the entries of that
     definition into the menu display(1). The default for a line item
     in a menu template definition is `FOLLOW' and so this attribute
     may be omitted. To explicitly override this behavour for
     individual instances use the `/NOFOLLOW' option as documented
     below.

  4. `/NOFOLLOW' -- informs ELSE that even though the line item is a
     placeholder, that is itself a menu, do not "follow" the definition
     by incorporating the entries of that definition into the menu
     display. Note that this option can be globally overriden by the
     `'else-follow-menus' and `'else-nofollow-menus' flags (*Note
     Custom Variables::.)

   For example, the `FULL_TYPE_DECLARATION' placeholder in the Ada
language templates has a body of:

         "type {identifier} [known_discriminant_part] is {type_definition};"
         "task_type_declaration"/PLACEHOLDER
         "protected_type_declaration"/PLACEHOLDER

   This body tells ELSE that if the user selects the first line, then
perform a direct text substitution, if one of the other two lines are
selected then ELSE is being told that they refer to a further
placeholder and will be treated according to the `/TYPE' specifier of
that placeholder i.e. the indicated placeholder will be expanded.  See
also *Note Indentation Size::, for further information on applying
"hard" spaces to the beginning of a line of text in the body.

   An example of the use of the `FOLLOW' and `NOFOLLOW' is taken from
the Emacs-Lisp template file for the definition of the `STATEMENT'
placeholder(2):

         "let_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         "if_statement"/PLACEHOLDER
         .
         .
         .
         "property-list-stmt"/PLACEHOLDER
         "symbols"/PLACEHOLDER/NOFOLLOW
         "sequences"/PLACEHOLDER/NOFOLLOW
         .
         .

   Here the placeholder `property-list-stmt' is a menu which in turn has
multiple entries/options. If `else-follow-menus' is `nil', then ELSE
will "follow" the menu definitions for `property-list-stmt' and include
its items in the menu display, however, because `symbols' is followed by
`/NOFOLLOW' then its definitions will not be included in the primary
menu dispolay i.e. if the user wishes to select one of the options in
the `symbols' placeholder then they must explicity select the `symbols'
entry to be presented with the possible options at that level.

Placeholder Cross-Referencing
.............................

   Finally, the "body" of a placeholder definition may contain some or
none of the above attributes and purely reference another existing
placeholder i.e.

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER XYZ -
       /LANGUAGE="ABC"
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER XYZ -
       /LANGUAGE="ABC"
       /PLACEHOLDER=DEF
     
     END DEFINE

   Here we have a placeholder called "XYZ" which will automatically use
the definition of the placeholder "DEF" when it is referenced or
invoked by the ELSE routines. This can be extremely useful in
situations such as the following where the EBNF for a language might
specify two forms of "identifier" which you wish to ideally make the
same w.r.t ELSE behaviour e.g. when the user enters a string for
`subprogram_identifier' ELSE should perform an auto-substitution on the
following `defining_identifier' placeholder.

        procedure {subprogram_identifier} is
           ...
        end [defining_identifier];

   We may not want to necessarily change the template definition to
generate:

        procedure {defining_identifier} is
           ...
        end [defining_identifier];

   and then have to define a placeholder definition for
`defining_identifier' that includes auto-substitution behaviour,
because `defining_identifier' may appear somewhere else as a
"singleton". The ideal would be to have a placeholder definition for
`subprogram_identifier' that defined auto-substitute behaviour but also
referred to the definition of `defining_identifier' for its basic
behaviour i.e. if we use the following definition then when the user
types in a `subprogram_identifier' placeholder ELSE will search for a
matching `defining_identifier' placeholder and perform
auto-substitution there:

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER SUBPROGRAM_IDENTIFIER -
       /LANGUAGE="ABC"
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER SUBPROGRAM_IDENTIFIER -
       /LANGUAGE="ABC"
       /AUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
       /PLACEHOLDER=DEFINING_IDENTIFIER

Token Definition
----------------

   There are only two forms to the definition of a Token, they are both
shown below. These two definitions show two different ways of
specifying the same thing. In the first instance, the definition is
using an existing placeholder definition and just referring to it as
the action to perform on expansion. The second form shows a textual
substitution form which acts in the same manner as a `NONTERMINAL'
placeholder (*note Type Specifier::).
     DELETE TOKEN IF -                   DELETE TOKEN IF -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -                   /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE TOKEN IF -                   DEFINE TOKEN IF -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -                   /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /PLACEHOLDER=IF_STATEMENT
                                             "if {condition} then"
     END DEFINE                              "  {statement}..."
                                             "[elsif_part]"
                                             "[else_part]"
                                             "end if;"
                                         END DEFINE

   The `DELETE' and `DEFINE' lines follow the same rules as for the
equivalent placeholder specifiers (*note Delete Placeholder
Statement::) and (*note Define Placeholder Statement::. Similarly for
the `LANGUAGE' specifier (*note Language Specifier::.

   The greatest strength of the token definition is that it provides
convenient "abbreviations" for the user i.e. the user doesn't have to
type out the full placeholder name and enclose it in braces. Tokens
provide the facility of a convenient stand alone string which can be
expanded into some other entity, either another placeholder definition
or as a textual string. Note that token definitions do not provide
"non-terminal" and "menu" facilities like the placeholder definition
however, this is off-set by the ability of the token definition to
refer to a placeholder definition which does provide these facilities.

   Of special note, ELSE searches the appropriate definition array
based upon the context of the string being expanded i.e. if the string
is enclosed in `{}''s or `[]''s then it will search the placeholder
array, if the string is "free-standing" then ELSE will search the token
array. Thus, template definition names do not have to be unique between
placeholders definitions and token definitions e.g. you could have a
placeholder definition called "if" and a token definition called "if"
without having any conflict.


File: else,  Node: Hooking Elisp Code into ELSE Templates,  Prev: Tokens,  Up: Definition of the Template Structure

Hooking Elisp Code into ELSE Templates
--------------------------------------

   On rare occasions it might be useful to associate some Elisp code
with ELSE templating activities. This can be "linked" to both
placeholder and token definitions using the same syntax (the following
examples show usage with placeholder definitions but the same syntax
applies equally to token definitions). The syntax is:


         /RUN_CODE=<elisp-defun><phase>

   where "elisp-defun" is the name of a Elisp defun and "phase" is the
"phase" of operation during which ELSE will call the defun. The
currently(1) defined "phases" are:

   * /BEFORE -- Call `elisp-defun' "before" the placeholder/token is
     expanded (invoked during execution of `else-expand-placeholder'
     (`C-c / e'));

   * /AFTER - Call `elisp-defun' "after" the placeholder/token has been
     expanded (invoked during execution of `else-expand-placeholder'
     (`C-c / e'));

   * /ONINSERT -- Call `elisp-defun' when a "self-insert" character is
     typed with point in the placeholder (this phase option is
     meaningless for tokens).


   A definition (placeholder or token) may have multiple `/RUN_CODE'
lines indicating a separate elisp-defun to call for each line. Each
`/RUN_CODE' line may have only one elisp-defun but can have multiple
phase indicators i.e. the following example would have "elisp-test-dfn"
called during both the `/BEFORE' and `/AFTER' phases of the expansion.

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER XXXX -
        /LANGUAGE="yyy" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER XXXX -
        /LANGUAGE="yyy" -
        .
        .
        /RUN_CODE=else-test-dfn/BEFORE/AFTER
        .
     
     END DEFINE

   A more concrete example is shown using a definition found in the
ELSE template language itself (Template.lse). The definition for
placeholder "nonterminal|terminal_placeholder" is (partially shown for
brevity):

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER nonterminal|terminal_placeholder -
         /LANGUAGE="Template" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER nonterminal|terminal_placeholder -
         /LANGUAGE="Template" -
         .
         .
     
         "    /{substitute}"
         "    [substitute_count]"
         "    /DESCRIPTION={descriptive_text} -"
         .
         .
     
     END DEFINE

   The "{substitute}" placeholder is a menu that leads to either
`/NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE' or `/AUTO_SUBSTITUTE' -- however, if the user
selects `/NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE' then they have to manually delete the
redundant placeholder "[substitute_count]". A possible solution (this
can be solved with slightly different ELSE template definitions, BTW)
is to use the `/RUN_CODE' attribute and accompany it with an
appropriate elisp defun. In this scenario, the definition of
"substitute" changes from:

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTE -
         /LANGUAGE="Template" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTE -
         /LANGUAGE="Template" -
         .
         .
         /TYPE=MENU -
     
         "NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -"
         "AUTO_SUBSTITUTE -"
     
     END DEFINE

   to this (incorporating the run-time attribute):

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTE -
         /LANGUAGE="Template" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER SUBSTITUTE -
         /LANGUAGE="Template" -
         .
         .
         /RUN_CODE=process-substitute/AFTER
         /TYPE=MENU -
     
         "NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -"
         "AUTO_SUBSTITUTE -"
     
     END DEFINE

   and the user "compiles" the following elisp defun into their edit
session (place in a convenient .el file that gets loaded, your .emacs
file or whatever):

     (defun process-substitute ()
       "Determine whether the next placeholder after a [substitute] should
     be deleted or left intact - could make this more 'robust' by testing
     whether the placeholder is a [substitute_count] before deleting......"
       (let ()
         (if (else-scan-for-match "/NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE" nil t)
             (progn
               (else-next-placeholder)
               (else-delete-placeholder)))))

   Now when "`{substitute}'" is expanded, the Elisp defun
`process-substitute' is run "after" the expansion and decides whether
the "`[substitute_count]'" placeholder remains or not depending upon
which option the user selected.

   Note that this example relies on "published" ELSE defuns
(`else-next-placeholder' and `else-delete-placeholder') and an
"unpublished" defun `else-scan-for-match'. The later is used to scan the
text before point (search limited to the beginning of the line in this
case) and look for the text `/NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE' -- if it is found then
the "`[substitute_count]'" is not wanted and is deleted.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Other possibilties are /ON_ENTRY and /ON_EXIT i.e. calling
defuns as ELSE moves point into or out of a placeholder -- if there is
demand for these "phases" I will implement them


File: else,  Node: Example of Creating A New Language Template,  Prev: Definition of the Template Structure,  Up: Creating and Modifying Templates

Example of Creating A New Language Template
===========================================

   Use of ELSE shines for "verbose", structured languages such as Ada,
Modula-2, Pascal etc and performs not so well for what I will call
unstructured "minimalist" languages such as C and C++. Obviously, the
aim in the definition of languages such as Modula-2, Pascal etc was to
provide code that was more readable and therefore easier to check and
maintain. Languages such as C and C++ were designed (C++, due to its
desire to be backward compatible with C) for minimal code entry effort
which results in code with minimal readability and therefore
maintainability.

   When creating language templates it is important to keep in mind
that there is a point where the trade-off of template availability
versus user effort is reached i.e. even for "verbose" languages, I
would not recommend providing templates for the "expression" construct.
It is easier to just provide a prompt string at this point rather than
to follow the path that the language syntax lays out, because at this
stage the user is only required to type in something like `A = B' or
something equally simple. Remember the aim of ELSE is to reduce
keystrokes and improve productivity, so providing templates that allow
the user to select from the many permutations that lead from a typical
language "expression" syntax is not warranted either on your part of
template design or on the users part of code entry.

   If you are faced with developing a set of language templates then
there are two possible courses of action. You can either establish a
bare minimum of constructs that will suit your needs i.e. template
definitions for the common language constructs such as "statement", "if
statement", "case statement", "procedure or function statement" etc or
you can go the "whole hog" and provide a "complete" set of templates
right down to definitions for common library calls etc.

   One of the benefits of the "bare minimum" approach is that you can
cater for the large portion of code entry with only a couple of hours
work to develop the template definitions. Whereas if you opt for the
"whole hog" approach then it may involve quite a few hours work.
Creation of language template definitions is a very manual, mechanical
task and is not always easy since you are usually working from a
specification for the language such as a set syntax diagrams. Such
syntax diagrams are rarely suitable for straight incorporation into a
set of language template definitions. There is usually a fair amount of
manually going through the syntax looking for simplifications etc.

   If you are going for the complete approach then you are advised to
start from a set of EBNF syntax diagrams for the language. To relieve
the amount of work required for this approach, I have written a program
that helps enormously in the effort of going from the EBNF to the
language definition file. This program is available upon request, just
email me and I will send you the latest copy (its comes in binary form
because I am too embarrassed to release it, it was my very first effort
at using both literate programming and C++ :-), perhaps one day I will
re-do it based upon experiences learnt). The program is available for
Win95 platforms only.

   The following attempts to provide some definition of the EBNF
structure and examples with accompanying language template definitions.
EBNF syntax diagrams are useful because they can be used to determine
when a particular construct should be optional, mandatory, whether it
should auto-repeat and whether there are any "punctuation" strings
required.

   It was somewhat difficult to run down a definition of EBNF syntax,
hopefully the following is accurate, please provide corrections if I am
wrong :-).

   In EBNF the following rules apply:
  1. Square brackets enclose optional items, thus the two following
     rules are equivalent.
             return_statement ::= return [expression];
             return_statement ::= return; | return expression;

  2. Curly braces enclose a repeated item. The item may appear zero or
     more times, the repetitions occur from left to right as with an
     equivalent left-recursive rule. Thus the two following rules are
     equivalent:
             term ::= factor {multiplying_operator factor}
             term ::= factor | term multiplying_operator factor

  3. A vertical line separates alternative items unless it occurs
     immediately after an opening curly bracket, in which case it
     stands for itself:
             constraint ::= scalar_constraint | composite_constraint
             discrete_choice_list ::= discrete_choice {| discrete_choice}

  4. Items that repeat are enclosed within braces, any character that
     appears after the opening curly brace defines a "separator" string
     ie. a string that appears between each occurrence of the repeating
     construct (refer to example in previous item)

   It is important to note in the following examples, that the keywords
of the language being converted are copied verbatim into the language
template definition, any other text is converted to either a mandatory
or optional placeholder depending on how the EBNF defines their usage.
Examples that illustrate these points are shown below. The EBNF
construct is shown first followed by the equivalent ELSE template
definition.


     return_statement ::= return [expression];
     
     DELETE PLACEHOLDER RETURN_STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER RETURN_STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
         /DESCRIPTION=""
         /DUPLICATION=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT -
         /SEPARATOR="" -
         /TYPE=NONTERMINAL -
     
         "return [expression];"
     
     END DEFINE

         sequence_of_statements ::= statement {statement}
     
     DELETE PLACEHOLDER SEQUENCE_OF_STATEMENTS -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER SEQUENCE_OF_STATEMENTS -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
         /DESCRIPTION=""
         /DUPLICATION=VERTICAL -
         /SEPARATOR="" -
         /TYPE=NONTERMINAL -
     
         "{statement}..."
     
     END DEFINE
   This example shows the definition of an item that appears zero or
more time, because a typical language syntax demands at least one
occurrence of a `statement' the EBNF shows a single instance (the
mandatory single instance) followed by the instance enclosed in curly
braces which is specified as repeating "zero or more times". Thus we
"code" the template definition as single item enclosed by curly braces
(which in ELSE means a mandatory entry). Remember that the ... denote
auto-repeat, so when the placeholder is repeated it will be enclosed by
square brackets and will thus be an optional entry. Thus we achieve the
original intent of the ENBF.

   In practice, you would not define the construct
`sequence_of_statements' as it appears by itself and is used in other
constructs such as:
         if_statement ::=  if condition then
                             sequence_of_statements
                           {elsif condition then
                             sequence_of_statements}
                           [else
                             sequence_of_statements]
                           end if;
   So rather than define the language template such that the user is
forced to expand `sequence_of_statements', we perform a "substitution"
ourselves so that our `if' construct looks like:
         if_statement ::=  if condition then
                             statement {statement}
                           {elsif condition then
                             statement {statement}}
                           [else
                             statement {statement}]
                           end if;
   Which would lead us to a language template of:

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER IF_STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
     DEFINE PLACEHOLDER IF_STATEMENT -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         /NOAUTO_SUBSTITUTE -
         /DESCRIPTION=""
         /DUPLICATION=CONTEXT_DEPENDENT -
         /SEPARATOR="" -
         /TYPE=NONTERMINAL -
     
         "if {condition} then"
         "  {statement}..."
         "[elsif_part]..."
         "[else_part]"
         "end if;"
     
     END DEFINE
   This step also shows the `elsif' and `else' portion being modified
for incorporation into the template language. Placeholders may not span
lines, so any EBNF construct that does so must be reduced to a
placeholder that can be produced on one line. The syntax for the `if'
statement is a good example of this having to be done. The following
shows the equivalent EBNF and language templates for these structures:
                                             DELETE PLACEHOLDER ELSIF_PART -
     elsif_part ::=                              /LANGUAGE="Ada" -
         elsif condition then                DEFINE PLACEHOLDER ELSIF_PART -
           statement {statement}               /LANGUAGE="Ada" -

                                                 "  {statement}..."
     
                                             END DEFINE
     
                                             DELETE PLACEHOLDER ELSE_PART -

         else                                DEFINE PLACEHOLDER ELSE_PART -
           statement {statement}               /LANGUAGE="Ada" -

                                                 /SEPARATOR="" -
                                                 /TYPE=NONTERMINAL -
     
                                                 "else"
                                                 "  {statement}..."
     
                                             END Define

   The following is an example of syntax that repeats with a separator
string present. The construct is the (partial) Ada syntax for an object
declaration. Just to provide the context, the (partial) EBNF is shown
first.

     object_declaration ::=
       defining_identifier_list : [aliased] [constant] subtype_indication [:= \
     expression];
     
         defining_identifier_list ::=
           defining_identifier {, defining_identifier}

   Here, `defining_identifier_list' is defined as a
`defining_identifier' that must occur one or more times and is separated
by the string ", " when it does repeat. Thus, this EBNF leads to:

     DELETE PLACEHOLDER DEFINING_IDENTIFIER -
         /LANGUAGE="Ada" -

   Here we can see the /SEPARATOR attribute be used, duplication is set
for the horizontal direction and the placeholder is defined as a
TERMINAL placeholder with an appropriate prompt message.

Custom Variables
****************

   ELSE has a small (but growing) number of custom variables, these are
available through the Customisation Groups under the customisation
group `Programming - Tools - Emacs LSE'. These variables are (listed
alphabetically):

 - Custom Variable: else-direction
     This variable determines which direction the command
     `else-move-n-placeholders' will attempt i.e. if the variable is
     "on" then the command `else-next-placeholder' (`C-c / n') will be
     used, if the variable is "off" then the command
     `else-previous-placeholder' (`C-c / p') will be used. The default
     for this variable is 't' (on).

 - Custom Variable: else-follow-menus
     If true (`t') then menu definitions are 'followed' or expanded
     until no sub-entry menu is found and all are combined into a
     single menu selection display at the 'top level'. If `nil', then
     menu's are not expanded and the user has to traverse sub-menu
     entries (useful when combining menu's leads to huge menu
     selections).

     Setting this flag to `t' will explicitly override the settings of
     individual template definitions that use the `/NOFOLLOW' attribute
     (*Note Template Body::.)

     The default for this variable is `nil' (off) as the default
     behaviour of ELSE is to "follow" menu definitions unless
     explicityly told not to by the `/NOFOLLOW' attribute.

     This variable may be overriden by the setting of
     `'else-nofollow-menus' to `t'.

     This flag is a buffer-local variable so individual buffers can
     have individual settings.

     This also means that setting the variable through the Emacs
     Customisation menu will set the global value for the variable but
     not actually affect the setting of any "current" buffers that are
     using this variable. Only "new" buffers will inherit the new value
     set via the customisation menu.

     See the Emacs manual for instructions on changing a variable from
     the command line (Evaluating Emacs-Lisp Expressions).

 - Custom Variable: else-ignore-case-in-name-sorts
     Used by ELSE when sorting output (else-extract-all,
     else-show-token-names, else-show-placeholder-names ) into
     alphabetical order. A value of `t' will ignore case when sorting
     the names i.e.

          PASS
          print
          RETURN

     A value of `nil' will produce a sorted list that is case sensitive
     i.e.

          PASS
          RETURN
          .
          .
          print

     The default for this variable is `t' (ignore case).

 - Custom Variable: else-kill-proceed-to-next-placeholder
     This is a "usability" variable that controls the behaviour of the
     command `else-kill-placeholder' (`C-c / k') after it has executed.
     If this variable is set (on) then ELSE will attempt to perform a
     `else-next-placeholder' (`C-c / n') after successfully killing a
     placeholder. If the variable is "off" then the cursor will remain
     at the point at which the kill command was executed. The default is
     `nil' (off).

 - Custom Variable: else-move-and-execute
     Another "usability" variable. If this variable is "on" then after
     either an expansion or kill request (`else-expand-placeholder'
     (`C-c / e') or `else-kill-placeholder' (`C-c / k')) which has
     failed, then a "movement" (either a "next" or "previous"
     placeholder - direction is dependent upon the setting of the
     `else-direction' flag) command is executed and the original
     operation (expand or kill) will be attempted again at the new
     placeholder(1). The default for this variable is `nil' (off).

 - Custom Variable: else-nofollow-menus
     If true (`t') then menu definitions are not 'followed' -- when
     `t', this variable takes precedence over the setting of
     `'else-follow-menus' and any `/FOLLOW' or `/NOFOLLOW' attibutes of
     the template definition. If `nil', then the variable becomes
     "inactive" and determination of menu "follow" or not is determined
     based upon the settings of `'else-follow-menus' and thence the
     `/NOFOLLOW' and `/FOLLOW' attributes in that order.

     The default for this variable is `nil' (off).

     This flag is a buffer-local variable so individual buffers can
     have individual settings.

     This also means that setting the variable through the Emacs
     Customisation menu will set the global value for the variable but
     not actually affect the setting of any "current" buffers that are
     using this variable. Only "new" buffers will inherit the new value
     set via the customisation menu.

     See the Emacs manual for instructions on changing a variable from
     the command line (Evaluating Emacs-Lisp Expressions).

 - Custom Variable: else-only-proceed-within-window
     This flag is used only if the
     else-kill-proceed-to-next-placeholder flag is set. The movement to
     the next placeholder will only occur if the placeholder is visible
     in the current window. If this flag is off then the movement will
     proceed (possibly) causing visual disorientation to the user when
     the screen display jumps. The default for this variable is 't'
     (on).

 - Custom Variable: else-prompt-time
     This variable supplies the time which a prompt string to the user
     is displayed for a TERMINAL placeholder (*note Type Specifier::).
     The default is 3 seconds.

 - Custom Variable: else-set-lineno
     Controls the display of line numbers in the menu display window.
     The default for this variable is `nil' (off).

   This chapter provides some "technical" information that doesn't fall
into any particular category for inclusion in previous chapters. The
information offered covers:
  1. "useful" variables/functions that are contained within
     else-mode.el. This is a brief description of the some of the
     variables/functions that an individual might want to access/call
     from outside of ELSE to perform various tasks.  This list is
     probably not exhaustive but hopefully helpful.  (1)

Useful ELSE Defuns
==================

   Description of some useful Defuns that ELSE contains that users can
access (they are non-interactive) from their own elisp Defuns to
perform useful actions.

 - apropos: else-after-token
     Return `t' if point is situated immediately after a valid token
     string for the language definition in force for that buffer.

 - apropos: else-in-placeholder
     Returns `t' if point is within a valid placeholder for the language
     definition in force for that buffer.  See also
     else-placeholder-start and else-placeholder-end.

 - apropos: else-dump-language
     Dump the current buffer language template to the named file.  Note
     that the file name parameter must have been already vetted to make
     sure it complies with the else naming conventions i.e. .esl

 - apropos: else-establish-language language-name
     Set language template set 'language-name as the current template
     set for this buffer.

 - apropos: else-look-up name-string &optional ignore-forward-refs
     Look-up the definition of a placeholder/token called 'name-string.
     'ignore-forward-refs allows functions like
     `'else-kill-placeholder' to stop the forwarding referrals i.e. we
     wish to kill what is there not what might have been there

 - apropos: else-placeholder-start
     Position in the buffer of the start of the last placeholder
     detected/found (see else-in-placeholder).

 - apropos: else-placeholder-end
     Position in the buffer of the end of the last placeholder
     detected/found (see else-in-placeholder).

Editing Template Files
======================

   ELSE comes with a template definition language file for creating and
maintaining language template files. It is called template.lse. When
editing template definition files you can have ELSE enabled for the
buffer and it will load the template.lse definitions. However, when
performing common ELSE functions (common to editing a language template
file that is) it will perform in terms of the language of the buffer
contents rather than the ELSE template language itself i.e. if you are
editing C.lse and wish to perform an extraction of a current C language
definition then you can run `else-extract-placeholder' and it will look
in the C language definitions for the requested definition rather than
the template definitions. Likewise, when compiling the current buffer
the definitions will go into the C language definitions rather than the
ELSE language template definitions. The only exception to this rule is
the commands that are obviously relevant to editing a language
definition file in its own language i.e. `else-expand-placeholder' will
still be expecting to expand placeholders and tokens that below to the
TEMPLATE definitions rather than the C definitions.


File: else,  Node: ELSE and Hooks,  Next: Building the Language Template File Name,  Prev: Editing Template Files,  Up: Technical Notes

ELSE and Hooks
==============

   Probably the most single significant feature that sets ELSE above
any other equivalent templating system for Emacs is the ability to
generate portions of text that can be easily located (placeholders) and
to which the cursor can be positioned (*note Navigating Using ELSE:
Navigating.). Once there, then typing by the user will cause the
automatic deletion of the placeholder and the insertion of the typed
text. This functionality is achieved by ELSE "hooking" into the before
and after change hooks of Emacs. Here it can monitor what is happening
in the changes to the buffer and take appropriate action (such as the
deletion of a placeholder when `self-insert' text is typed or the
duplication of typed text when the placeholder has identifier and
auto-substitute situation (*note Auto Text Substitute::)).

* Menu:

* Building the Language Template File Name::


File: else,  Node: Building the Language Template File Name,  Prev: ELSE and Hooks,  Up: Technical Notes

Building the Language Template File Name
========================================

   When ELSE mode is invoked for a buffer it will read the name of the
major mode currently in effect and append the file extension ".lse" and
attempt to load a file by that name using the 'load-path'. Note that
this function is case sensitive i.e. if the major mode for the buffer
is `C' then a file name of `C.lse' will be constructed and searched.
Similarly, if the major mode is Emacs-Lisp then ELSE will construct a
file name of 'Emacs-Lisp.lse'.

   If the constructed file name cannot be located in the `load-path'
then the user will be prompted for a file name.

Compatibility
*************

   ELSE is definitely known not to be compatible with versions of Emacs
prior to Emacs 20.X. Emacs Lisp introduced a change at 19.29 that I
took advantage of and then Emacs 20.X introduced the use of custom
variables which are also used in ELSE.

Notes for Voice Recognition Coding
**********************************

   It is recommended that people using Emacs and ELSE for programming
using Voice Recognition tools should set the following custom variables
(*note Custom Variables::).

  1. `else-kill-proceed-to-next-placeholder'

  2. `else-set-lineno'

  3. `else-move-and-execute'

  4. `else-only-proceed-within-window'

   Having these variables set result in a minimum of voice commands to
navigate and input code using ELSE. Refer to demonstration videos using
ELSE, that Hans van Dam has kindly produced, at
<http://home.hetnet.nl/~vandamhans/index.htm>

Language Template Availability
******************************

   The following list indicates what language templates are currently
available from <http://www.zipworld.com.au/~peterm>. For further (and a
growing list) of other language templates, kindly made available by
Douglas Harter refer to <http://mywebpages.comcast.net/dharter46>.
Douglas currently has template files for Basic, Bliss, Bourne Shell, C
Shell, COBOL, DEC DCL, Fortran90, Fortran, PASCAL, Perl and the list is
growing.
  1. Ada83 -- must be renamed to Ada.lse prior to use. Has seen some
     extensive use in a programming environment so should be quite
     "usable"(1)

  2. Ada95 -- must be renamed to Ada.lse to be used. Usability index is
     moderate, I used these templates for about 6 months of coding,
     some obvious paths have not been fine tuned.

  3. ELSE Template Language (template.lse). Quite usable - use these
     templates to create ELSE language definition templates.

  4. LaTeX -- Usable but extremely small sub-set - I don't do
     documentation this way anymore - the world is succumbing to
     MS-Word :-(.

  5. Emacs-Lisp -- Usable not terrifically extensive.

  6. C -- Usable.

  7. Python -- Usable.

  8. C++ -- Not very Usable. Some work is being done by Stephen Leake.

  9. Java -- Not very Usable. Nobody is working with this template set
     to my knowledge.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Language template files have what I would term a "usability"
index as far as ELSE is concerned. The more extensively they are used
in programming the more "fine tuning" has been done to the template
definitions and thus they become more "usable" by the programmer.
Template files that have been freshly translated from the EBNF of a
language have a low usability index and should be regarded by beginners
with extreme caution.

Tutorial
********

   This tutorial assumes that you have followed the installation
instructions and have downloaded the C language templates (`C.lse' and
`C-cust.lse'), these files represent the base C language template files
(`C.lse') and the customisation templates that I use for my C
programming (`C-cust.lse'). For the tutorial to be as shown, it is
important that these two files are used, otherwise the code samples
shown may not be accurate.

   The tutorial uses the C language templates, as C is probably the
most recognised language (everybody has at some time or another been
exposed to some form of C syntax, using any of the other languages for
which ELSE templates are available might not have such a wide
recognition factor).

File: else,  Node: Abbreviation Coding,  Next: Whole Language Coding,  Prev: Tutorial,  Up: Tutorial

Using ELSE for Abbreviation Coding
==================================

   If you are in a "maintenance" type role i.e. working with modifying
or fixing existing code files, or perhaps you are completely new to
ELSE, then you might be more interested in the "abbreviation" powers of
ELSE.

   In these kind of coding situations, you are more likely to wish to
just add a couple of lines of code rather than write completely new
code from scratch. In the case of just adding several lines, then it is
convenient to have some quick and easy way to generate a common code
construct. You could type a placeholder directly into the buffer and
then expand it but this is somewhat laborious and is not necessarily
true to the underlying aim of ELSE, which is to reduce typing. To meet
these needs, ELSE offers something called "tokens". Tokens are a
template definition that takes a minimal number of characters and turns
them into some desired construct using the expand command (`C-c / e').
Most of the common language constructs available to ELSE should have
the common constructs available as tokens as well as placeholders i.e.
one such common construct is the "if statement". To generate an if
construct at point in the buffer, just perform the following key
sequence:

   `ifC-c / e'

   and you will have the following if construct appear:

       if ({expression}) {
         {statement}...
       }
       [elsif_part]...
       [else_part]

   Again, the cursor will be automatically positioned into the first
placeholder and options similar to that explained in the previous
section (*Note Whole Language Coding::).

   Another example of a simple, but common construct is the humble
comment statement. In `C-cust.lse' there is a token that allows quick
and easy comment generation. Type the following anywhere in the buffer:

   `cC-c / e'

   and you should see the text:
        /* {text} */

   The cursor will be positioned within the "text" placeholder and the
user can start typing the comment immediately.


File: else,  Node: Whole Language Coding,  Prev: Abbreviation Coding,  Up: Tutorial

Using ELSE for Whole Language Coding
====================================

   Open a new file, "example.c". When the new file is created, enable
ELSE for the buffer using `M-x else-mode'. You should see the following
in the buffer:

     {compilation_unit}

   The cursor should be positioned within the placeholder shown. This
is a top level language construct that should lead to all of the
possible paths to create a complete C language file. Expand the
placeholder by executing `C-c / e', which should result in the buffer
containing:

     [module_level_comments]
     [#include]...
     
     {translation_unit}...

   Again, the cursor will be positioned in the first placeholder
(`module_level_comments') of the expansion. Perform another expansion
(`C-c / e') and this placeholder will be replaced by the following text:

     /* ===[ {module} ]=========================================================
     
       Description:
     
         {text}

   The cursor will now be the next available placeholder (`module'). If
this placeholder is expanded (`C-c / e'), then the user will receive a
prompt screen with the following text:

     Enter the name of the module i.e. gs_lib.c

   This text will be visible for approximately 3 seconds (ELSE prompt
time - a customisable variable). This indicates to the user that there
is no further expansions available from the templates. The prompt
string itself offers informative text meant to help the user provide
the required information. The fact that the placeholder is a
"mandatory" placeholder (*note Typographical Conventions::) means that
the user must provide a value i.e. the placeholder cannot be deleted or
killed because the syntactic conventions require an entry to be made at
this point.

   Type in the text, `example.c' -- the placeholder will be deleted
automatically when the first letter is typed by the user.

   Now navigate to the placeholder `include_files' using repeated next
placeholder commands (`C-c / n'). Expand the placeholder (`C-c / e') and
you will be presented with a menu screen showing two possible choices
(as shown below):

     #include <{file_name}>
     #include "{file_name}"

   Select the first option by pressing the letter `s' on the keyboard
(selection can also be achieved by re-executing the expansion command
`C-c / e' -- this is a convenience option for individuals who may map
the ELSE expand command to a more convenient key sequence i.e. I have
the else-expand-placeholder command mapped to <F3> - by allowing this
behaviour, the user doesn't have to move fingers to achieve menu
selection.

   Enter the text `stdio.h', the buffer should now contain (excluding
the file header that we have already developed in the interest of
saving space):

     #include <stdio.h>
     [#include]...

   Note that the `#include' placeholder has been automatically repeated
(repetition of the placeholder is achieved by the inclusion of the
ellipses (...) at the end of the placeholder. This allows multiple
constructs to be easily repeated i.e. ELSE does the repetition -- it
would be extremely tedious if the user was forced to type in each
placeholder by hand.

   Navigate to the next placeholder and delete it using `C-c / k', this
will delete the text of the second instance of the `#include'
placeholder, including the braces and ellipses.

   Now navigate to the "translation_unit" placeholder and expand it,
you will be presented with a menu consisting of the following choices:

     function_definition
     declaration

   Select the first possibility (`function_definition') to receive the
following text in the buffer:

     [declaration_specifiers] {declarator}
     [declaration]...
     {
       [declaration]...
       [statement]...
     }

   You can navigate backwards (`C=c /p') and forwards through these
placeholders, expansion will lead to either prompt strings, menu
choices or simple text substitutions, depending upon the language
template definition for that placeholder. From these simple
placeholders an entire language file can be constructed. Since ELSE
generates all of the "house-keeping" characters such as opening and
closing braces, semi-colons that end the line etc, when it comes time
to compile this file, then the compiler should report a very much
reduced number of syntactic errors that if the file had been entered by
more traditional methods.

   Hopefully this tutorial has given you some small taste for the power
of ELSE and has whetted your appetite to learn more. Any questions

templates then just contact me at the email address on the front page
